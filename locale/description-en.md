# Easterling AIs (Applied)

This mod contains **14** new AIs, including 10 completely reworked lords.

### The AIs
These well-known friends have new spells and behaviors, just like you know them from **Stronghold 1**:
- Rat
- Snake
- Pig
- Wolf

As support against the evil four, Sir Longarm gets reinforcements from **Stronghold 1**:
- King - replaces Frederick
- Lord Woolsack - replaces Sheriff
- Abbot - replaces Abbot
- Lord Manikin - replaces Phillip
- Advisor - replaces Richard

**New** to this, from the ranks of the Assassins:
- Scorpion: *Al Mualim from Assassins Creed 1*

Adjusted AI behavior, **without** new spells/characters
- Arsonist: *Attention fire!* - replaces Caliph
- Camel: *Does not need food* - replaces Wazir
- Sultan: *Does not want peasants in his palace* - replaces Sultan
- Falcon: *Does not build a castle, but a flourishing trading city* - replaces Emir

### Easterling's AI Mod on ModDB
This is a different version. The AIs for UCP3 have been recycled. This is **not** 1:1 the old mod that was published on ModDB. This was made with the UCP2 and focused on the challenge in the crusade trail.
